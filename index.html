          Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
          preceptor after initiation.[27] The education was delivered through
          Gurukula. The relationship between Guru and his Shishya (students
          /diciples) was very important part of the education.[28] Takshasila
          (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher
          learning institute in India from possibly 8th century BCE, however, it
          is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in
          modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official
          membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have
          existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a
          Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India.
          Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in
          the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in the
          Pali language.[29] Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist
          monasteries. These institutions imparted practicaleducation, e.g.
          medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly
          visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban
          centers of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar) andManassa in
          Nagpur, among others.[citation needed] These institutions
          systematically imparted knowledge andattracted a number of foreign
          students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic,
          páligrammar, etc. Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most
          famous teachers, associated with founding ofMauryan Empire

          Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
          system, which fall under the command of the government at three
          levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian
          Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
          Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
          fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
          public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Up until 1976,
          education policies and implementation were determined legally by each
          of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the
          constitution in 1976 made education a 'concurrent subject'. From this
          point on the central and state governments shared formal
          responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a
          country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union
          territories, this means that the potential for variations between
          states in the policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary
          education is vast.

          At the school level, Board of Open Schooling and Skill Education,
          Sikkim (BOSSE), National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) provides
          opportunities for continuing education to those who missed completing
          school education. 1.4 million students are enrolled at the secondary
          and higher secondary level through open and distance learning.[133] In
          2012 various state governments also introduced "State Open School" to
          provide distance education.[134] At higher education level, Indira
          Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) co-ordinates distance
          learning. It has a cumulative enrolment of about 1.5 million, serviced
          through 53 regional centres and 1,400 study centres with 25,000
          counselors. The Distance Education Council (DEC), an authority of
          IGNOU is co-coordinating 13 State Open Universities and 119
          institutions of correspondence courses in conventional universities.
          While distance education institutions have expanded at a very rapid
          rate, but most of these institutions need an up gradation in their
          standards and performance. There is a large proliferation of courses
          covered by distance mode without adequate infrastructure, both human
          and physical. There is a strong need to correct these imbalances.[135]
          Massive open online course are made available for free by the HRD
          ministry and various educational institutes..
